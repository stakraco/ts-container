/**
 * A forward reference wraps a class reference in a function to break
 * circular dependency chains in the module graph.
 *
 * The `forwardRef` property is a function that returns the actual class
 * reference. It's called lazily by the scanner and `@Inject()` decorator
 * after all modules have been defined.
 *
 * @typeParam T - The type of the referenced class or value
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { forwardRef } from '@stackra-inc/ts-container';
 *
 * @Module({
 *   imports: [forwardRef(() => CatsModule)],
 * })
 * class DogsModule {}
 * ```
